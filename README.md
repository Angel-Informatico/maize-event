## 📖 About

This is the source code for the **Pokémon Maize Event Giveaway** website. Originally hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), this application generates unique 13-number codes that players can enter in-game to receive special event Pokémon.

[**Pokémon Maize**](https://github.com/huderlem/maize) is a ROM hack of Pokémon Red Version that features an in-game system where players can enter codes to receive special Pokémon. The website takes a player's Trainer ID and generates a personalized code that can be redeemed at the Agate City PokéCenter.

✨ **All event Pokémon are shiny!** ✨

### ⚡ Flying/Surfing Pikablue
